# Lurk users and collaborations
This is a public repository to support ongoing Lurk collaborations. It should serve as a hub for non-transient discussion and resource sharing. 

A central "epic" issue for each specific collaboration can serve as the primary thread for discussion, and sub- or "child" issues can be created for more granular discussions as helpful. 

To follow other conversation related to Lurk collaborations, [join our Discord](filecoinproject.slack.com) or join the #lurk channel on the [Filecoin Slack workspace](https://filecoinproject.slack.com).
